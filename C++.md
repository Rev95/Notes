- **Stack Unwinding**  - Stack Unwinding is generally related to Exception Handling. In C++, when an exception occurs, the function call stack is linearly searched for the exception handler, and all the entries before the function with exception handler are removed from the function call stack. So exception handling involves Stack Unwinding if exception is not handled in same function (where it is thrown). Destructors for local objects would be called in Stack Unwinding process.
